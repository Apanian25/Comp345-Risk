# Comp345-Risk
The specific project for this semester consists in building a simple “Risk” computer game. The developed program
will have to be compatible with the rules of the “Warzone” version of Risk, which can be accessed at:
https://www.warzone.com/. A Warzone game consists of a connected graph map representing a world map,
where each node is a territory and each edge represents adjacency between territories. Two or more players can
play by placing armies on territories they own, from which they can attack adjacent territories to conquer them.
The objective of the game is to conquer all territories on the map.
